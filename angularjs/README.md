# AngularJS
AngularJS is a powerful Javascript framework for building single-page applications. It is being used widely on campus today.

## Style Guide
A group of several Angular developers on campus met recently and agreed that the best overall style guide available for Angular at this time is the following:

https://github.com/johnpapa/angularjs-styleguide

DoIT developers are highly encouraged to follow the recommendations in that guide when developing AngularJS applications. Exceptions will be noted below.
If, at some point, there are enough exceptions, we will create our own guide or fork from that one.

For structuring your application, refer especially to the following sections:
https://github.com/johnpapa/angularjs-styleguide#application-structure-lift-principle
and

## Helpful Modules
The following Angular modules have been used by areas within DoIT and have been found to be helpful. You should consider using these modules in your project if applicable.
People who have offered to be contacts if you have questions about using a particular module are also provided.

Module  | Contacts | Notes
------- | -------- | -----
[AngularUI](https://angular-ui.github.io/) | | A number of different modules that are generally well supported and useful, including directives for Bootstrap components, a full-featured Grid, drag-and-drop sorting of arrays, etc.
[Angular Translate](http://angular-translate.github.io/) | Ed O'Connor-Giles | i18n made easy
[ngStorage](https://github.com/gsklee/ngStorage) | | localStorage and sessionStorage done right for AngularJS
[Pagination Directive](https://github.com/michaelbromley/angularUtils/tree/master/src/directives/pagination) | | Pagination directive

## Learning Resources
Normally we might list a slew of links, but why maintain that ourselves? Refer instead to the
